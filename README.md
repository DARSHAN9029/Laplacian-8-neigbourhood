Laplacian 8-Neighborhood Edge Detection

This project implements the Laplacian 8-neighborhood method for edge detection in images. By applying a second-order derivative filter, it enhances edge details and improves feature extraction for computer vision tasks.

What It Does?

Processes grayscale images to detect edges.
Uses the Laplacian operator with an 8-neighborhood kernel.
Highlights high-frequency regions, improving image sharpness.

How It Works?
Converts the input image to grayscale (if needed).
Applies the Laplacian 8-neighborhood filter to detect intensity changes.
Outputs an enhanced image with well-defined edges.

Tools Used
Python for implementation.
OpenCV & NumPy for image processing.
Matplotlib for visualizing results.
